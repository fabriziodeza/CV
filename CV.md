## Skills Interested in Learning 
I would like to develop more skills working with linux and window machines. I would like to learn how to network these machines together and learn how to use the hardware that makes this possible. I would also like to expand on my knowledge of C++ and Java. I am curious to see more examples of how code is used in the real-world applications. 

## Time and Passion
I am currently enrolled in 15 hours while working a job and a internship. I am an RA at the University of Oklahoma and a systems engineering intern at The Boeing Company. I am very interested in learning more and hope to do so in this class, but have been streched thin by all of my prior commitments. I would do my best work with the time I have, but am afraid that I run the risk of overloading myself if I take on a more challenging project. Regardless, I hope to give it my all with the work that I am assigned.
